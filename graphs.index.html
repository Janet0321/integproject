<h2 style="color:GhostWhite;"> What are Graphs ?</h2>
<p style="color:GhostWhite;">The link between lines and points is described by a graph, which is a mathematical description of a network. A graph is made up of <br>
points with lines connecting them. It makes no difference how long the lines are or where the points are placed. A node is the name given to each object in a graph.
<br> Graphs are a popular way to visually represent data connections. A graph's goal is to convey data that are too many or intricate to be fully expressed in text 
<br>and in a limited amount of space.  A graph should be utilized if the data displays clear patterns or demonstrates relationships between variables.

<h2 style="color:GhostWhite;">Types Of Graphs :</h2>
<li style="color:GhostWhite;"><b>Histogram Graph</b><br>
-  A histogram is a data representation that looks like a bar graph that buckets a variety of outcomes into columns along the x-axis. 
The y-axis may be used to illustrate data distributions by representing the numerical count or percentage of occurrences in each column.
<li style="color:GhostWhite;"><b>Pie Graph (Circle Graph)</b><br>
- A pie chart is a spherical statistical visual that is split into slices to show numerical proportion. The arc length of each slice in a 
pie chart is proportionate to the quantity it shows.
<li style="color:GhostWhite;"><b>Flowchart</b><br>
- A flowchart is a diagram that shows how a workflow or process works. A flowchart is a diagrammatic depiction of an algorithm, or a step-by-step 
procedure for completing a job. The flowchart depicts the stages as various types of boxes, with arrows linking the boxes in a logical order.
<li style="color:GhostWhite;"><b>Bar Graph</b><br>
- A bar chart or bar graph is a chart or graph that uses rectangular bars with heights or lengths proportionate to the values they represent to convey categorical 
data. The bars can be plotted either horizontally or vertically. A column chart is another name for a vertical bar chart.
<li style="color:GhostWhite;"><b>Line Graph</b><br>
- A line graph is a visual representation of data that evolves over time. A line graph shows a continuous shift in the values indicated by the data points 
by connecting them with a straight line.

<h2 style="color:GhostWhite;"> Why do we use graphs and why are they important ?</h2>
<p  style="color:GhostWhite;"> </p>

<h2 style="color:indianred;"> How Does This Help In Our Lives? </h2> 
<p style="color:indianred;"> In real life, graphs can be used in a variety of ways. A line graph in the shape of a straight line, for example, denotes a linear 
relationship between two quantities shown on the x- and y-axes. That would reveal whether one increases while the other drops, or whether both increase or decrease 
at the same time, as well as whether one increases more than the other.<br><br>
There are also bar graphs and circle graphs that indicate the relative magnitude of various elements at a glance. A bar graph, for example, may show the relative 
strength of the many communities that make up a town's population. A circle graph can represent the percentage of money spent on various household items over the 
course of a month.</p>
