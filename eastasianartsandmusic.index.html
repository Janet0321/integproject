<p> </p>
<h3> Introduction to East Asian Arts and Music </h3>
<h4> What is arts and music?</h4>
<p> Art music, in contrast to pop and folk music, is a broad phrase used to denote consciously created music, notably in Western nations. 
The term "art music" refers to musical traditions that combine sophisticated structural and theoretical considerations with a documented 
musical legacy. </p>    
<h4> Whys is it so important and what does it have to do with their culture? </h4>
<p> It is an important aspect of our culture since it helps us to have a better knowledge of our emotions, 
as well as develop our self-awareness and openness to new ideas and experiences. At its most fundamental level, 
music may assist us in learning any language. Music is also a means of communication and expression for us. 
Communication is important in many cultures, and putting on a show and singing may help individuals communicate their true feelings. 
The power of music can help people communicate more effectively. Arts bring people together, and culture helps people respect each other's
differences. They help people comprehend each other. These topics' lessons can be used to develop beneficial behaviors and lifestyles that 
require constancy. Making growth and improving one's life takes time. </p>
<h4> <b> A Recap about Arts and Music </b> </h4>
<p> <b> The different kinds of arts and music coming from different cultures all have their own uniqueness and style. Why don't we 
go and look at a few examples of them? </b> <br>
<br> the examples i will be showing are just a few of all the kinds out there 
<h4> <b> What are the kinds of arts out there? There are a lot! I will be showing and explaining about the <b> Korean Folk Painting, 
the Tea Ceremony, and Jade Carving! <b/> </h4>
<p> <b> Korean Folk Painting ! </b> <br>
<p> - Korean painting encompasses all types of paintings created in Korea or by Koreans living abroad. 
It comprises anything from petroglyphs to post-modern conceptual art that uses fleeting light patterns. 
Korean painting, like other East Asian artworks, values the beauty of space. <br> 
<br> - Minhwa is a term used to describe Korean folk art created mostly by nomadic or untrained artists who imitate contemporary fine 
art styles for the sake of everyday utility or adornment. Yanagi Muneyoshi invented the word "minhwa." Minhwa literally translates <br>
to "people's painting" or "popular painting." <br> 
<br> - The power of Korean art and its creators was found in its simplicity, spontaneity, and a sense of harmony with nature. 
The primary tendency in Korean art has been naturalistic throughout the ages, a quality that can be seen as early as the Three Kingdoms period. </p>
<h4> <b> Japanese Tea Ceremony ! </b> </h4>
<br> - The Japanese tea ceremony is a cultural practice in Japan that involves the ceremonial preparation and presentation of matcha, 
<br> a powdered green tea, and the art of temae. The creation of the Japanese tea ritual was heavily influenced by Zen Buddhism. </p> 
<br> - The Japanese Tea Ceremony symbolizes peace, respect, purity, and tranquility, all of which must be embraced in order 
<br> to attain the tea ceremony's principal goal. This event is unique in that every step of the procedure, from the preparation 
<br> of the tea equipment to the drinking of the tea, is done in a unique way. 
<br> - It is a traditional method of making and drinking green tea in a tearoom on a tatami floor. One of the major aims of the tea ceremony, 
<br> aside from serving and receiving tea, is for the guests to appreciate the host's hospitality in a setting away from the quick pace of ordinary life. </p>
<br> - The tea scoop, whisk, and tea bowl are all ritually washed before being utilized in the ceremonial. After exchanging bows, 
<br> the first visitor is presented with a bowl of tea. They take a drink, praise the host on the tea, bow, and then clean the rim of 
<br> the cup before passing it on to the next visitor. </p> 
<h4> <b> Chinese Jade Carving ! </b> </h4> 
<p> - Jade carving is one of China's oldest and most important art forms, a tradition-rich skill that represents Chinese philosophy and culture. 
Folk workshops mostly concentrated on the carving of ordinary jade items such as jewelry and vessels throughout this time period. 
(Thomas and Lee, 1986) </p> 
<p> - The Chinese think that jade denotes purity, beauty, longevity, and even immortality, which is one of the reasons why carved-jade 
products were (and still are) so valuable. Jade carvers also prized the stone for its glistening, transparent colors, and hues. </p> 
<p> - The stones could not be cut with a metal knife, so they were fashioned with a rope and sand serving as an abrasive before 
being more accurately carved with a drill and then polished. They were excavated from mountains and picked up in riverbeds, 
and therefore known as 'the essence of heaven and earth.' </p> 
<h4> <b> What are the kinds of music out there? There are a lot! I will be showing and explaining about <b> Gugak (국악),
Hōgaku (邦楽), and Guoyue (國樂) </b> </h4>
<p> <b> Gugak ! </b> </p>
<p> - Since antiquity, Korean traditional or folk music (known as "gukak" in Korean) has been passed down down the generations. 
Gukak features a number of different characteristics, ranging from the music's most fundamental ingredients to its tone and structure. </p>
<p> - The music of the ordinary people is known as gugak. Western music's composition and order are its greatest assets. </p> 
<p> - The janggu, an hourglass-shaped drum, the gayageum, a 12-stringed zither, and the haegeum, a stringed instrument comparable to a violin, 
make up the fundamental gugak trio of instruments. </p> 
<h4> <b> Hōgaku ! </b> </h4>
<p> - Hôgaku literally translates to "homeland music." Hôgaku is a generic name for Japanese music that encompasses Gagaku, 
which may be regarded as imperial court music, and Shômyô, which comprises liturgical chants in Buddhist music and folk songs, 
according to most music dictionaries. </p> 
<p> - The shakuhachi and shamisen are the two major instruments of Japanese folk music known as Minyo. The melody is played on the 
shamisen in a staccato, rhythmical form, while the shakuhachi plays it in a flowing, lyrical style. </p>
<h4> <b> Guoyue ! </b> </h4> 
<p> - The word guoyue was frequently used in the early twentieth century to distinguish between imported Western music and native Chinese music. 
As a result, all Han Chinese music was included, but nothing written for Western instruments was omitted. 
It encompasses all Chinese instrumental music, opera, and other forms in its fullest definition. </p> 
<p> - Guoyue is a term that today refers to music written for Chinese musical instruments as an extension of Chinese traditional music. 
It's frequently written for a big performance with a large Chinese orchestra, as well as solo instrument performances. </p> 
<h4> <b> Conclusion: </b> </h4>
<p> Art in our environment, whether it's a painting, music, or even movies, has a significant influence on our mood and emotions. 
Art may have a good impact on our emotions, helping us feel better, calmer, or even inspired to accomplish something. Everywhere you look, there is art. </p>
