<h3> Hii !! I am Janet Fernandez, 13 year old female, student in a Grade 8 - Blessed in the school Small World Christian School Foundation (SWCSF). <br> 
I made this website with the intention to <b> show others what ecosystems are for </b> I hope you will be able to find this website helpful !

<h1> Introduction to Ecosystems ! What are ecosystems and what are they for? </h1>
<h3> <b> What is the Ecosystem? <br>
<p>An ecosystem is made up of all the species that interact with each other as well as the physical environment in which they live. 
<br> Nutrient cycles and energy fluxes bind these biotic and abiotic components together. Photosynthesis brings energy into the system, 
<br>which is absorbed into plant tissue. It is a community of living and non-living organisms that operate together, and it is made up of both abiotic
<br>(soil, water, and air) and biotic (life things) components (flora, fauna). An ecosystem can range in size from a desert to a single tree. <br> Water, 
water temperature, plants, animals, air, light, and soil are the key components of an ecosystem. </p>
<h3> What makes an ecosystem? <br> 
<p>An ecosystem is a geographical region in which plants, animals, and other species, as well as weather and topography, interact to generate<br> 
a living bubble. Ecosystems comprise both biotic and abiotic elements, or living and nonliving components.
<br> Freshwater, ocean water, and terrestrial 
ecosystems are divided into three types based on their overall habitat.</p> 
<h3> Why are ecosystems important? <br>
<p> It serves as a home for a variety of wild flora and animals. It encourages the development of numerous food chains and food webs. 
<br> It regulates vital ecological processes and helps people live longer. Participates in nutrient recycling between biotic and abiotic components. 
<br> Ecosystems that are healthy clean our water, filter our air, maintain our soil, manage the temperature, recycle nutrients, and feed us. 
<br>They supply raw materials and resources for pharmaceuticals and other uses. <br> It's that simple: these "ecosystem services" are essential to our survival. </p> 
<h2> <b> The 4 major processes in the ecosystem are: </b> </h2>
<h3> 1. The Water Cycle <br> 
<h4> <p> - The water cycle depicts the continual flow of water on Earth and in the atmosphere. <br>
Liquid water evaporates into water vapor, condenses into clouds, and precipitates as rain and snow on the ground. <br>
Water in various states travels through the atmosphere (transportation). <br>
- The water cycle is incredibly essential because it ensures that all living species have access to water and governs weather <br>
patterns on our planet. We would run out of clean water, which is necessary to life, if water did not naturally recycle itself. </p>
<h3> 2. The Mineral Cycle <br>
<h4> <p> - The mineral cycle is a biogeochemical and ecological process that controls mineral nutrient flow, distribution, <br>
and migration throughout the Earth's surface. Minerals are chemical substances made up of elements that exist naturally. <br>
- Nutrients are absorbed, transported, released, and reabsorbed throughout this process. It's a natural mineral nutrition recycling mechanism. <br>
After death and decomposition, nutrients eaten by plants and animals are returned to the environment, and the cycle continues. Microbes in the soil <br>
play a crucial role in nutrient recycling. </p>
<h3> 3. The Solar Energy flow <br>
<h4> <p> - Solar energy flow is a flow from the sun to the biosphere, not a cycle. The collection of solar energy through photosynthesis, <br>
the process by which green plants transform radiant energy from the sun into organic molecules such as glucose, is referred to as energy flow. <br>
- Solar energy flows out from the sun and across the solar system at all times. Solar energy is responsible for warming the Earth, causing wind <br>
and weather, and sustaining plant and animal life. The sun's energy, heat, and light are radiated away as electromagnetic radiation (EMR). </p>
<h3> 4. Community Dynamics <br>
<h4> <p> - The variations in community structure and composition through time are referred to as community dynamics. Environmental disturbances <br>
such as volcanoes, earthquakes, storms, fires, and climate change can sometimes cause these alterations. Equilibrium is defined as a community <br>
- Communities are complex entities whose structure (the types and numbers of species present) and behavior may be described (how communities change over time). <br>
Community ecologists can better manage ecosystems by understanding community structure and dynamics. </p>
<p> <b> Conclusion: </b> </p>
<h4> <p> As a society, we rely on healthy ecosystems to do a variety of things, including purifying the air so we can breathe properly, <br>
sequestering carbon for climate regulation, cycling nutrients so we can have clean drinking water without the need for expensive infrastructure, <br>
and pollinating our crops so we don't go hungry. <br>
A healthy ecosystem has a wide range of species and is less vulnerable to human interaction, natural catastrophes, and climate change. <br>
Every species has a place in its ecosystem where it contributes to the overall health of the system. </p>
